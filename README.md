#### Abstract:  
Based on a continuous internal energy state variable, we propose an explicit, 
fully non-linear Boltzmann collision operator for the evolution of distribution 
function describing a polyatomic gas with constant heat capacity. The particle 
interaction is a polyatomic generalization of the variable hard sphere model, used 
in a recent rigorous mathematical analysis, and includes frozen collisions. The 
model is consistent with the monatomic case and allows easy evaluations for moment 
equations and the Chapman-Enskog expansion. Using a publicly available computer 
algebra code we can explicitly compute nonlinear production terms for macroscopic 
systems of moments. The range of Prandtl number values recovers the Eucken formula 
for a specific choice of parameters.
